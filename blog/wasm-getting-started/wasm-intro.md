If you haven't heard about Rust or WASM yet, get excited. Rust is probably outside the interest of many web developers but I imagine many are at least aware because of it's creators' being the same as the Firefox browser. It's a lower-lever language with an emphasis on memory and thread safety. Contrasting with JS's fast and loose dynamic party, it's interesting to see them enter the same realm. WASM bridges these two worlds by creating a compile target for lower level languages (not just Rust) to reach the web.
