When I first learned about the JAMstack it was the middle, not the beginning.

I don't feel properly old enough for anything to have happened a decade ago but... About a decade ago I learned about Joseph Campbell's idea of the Hero's Journey. The whole thing's a bit fast and loose on the details for my liking but there are a couple pieces that I broke off to rattle around in my head. In that journey the hero returns to where they started. It feels that way when I learn things, I find myself returning to that initial question that sent me down the long road.

In the beginning, I was wondering "Why I shouldn't just be building my sites in HTML and CSS?" like *the good ol' days.* I had started there, visited jQuery for a while and traveled through tw frameworks to ask myself this. Working days on a SPA site with a hefty runtime and startup time to match I felt that we had lost ourselves somewhere.
