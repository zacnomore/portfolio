This article is intended to give developers the tools and concepts to show that value to your organization. Not everyone will see that value immediately and there are times that accessibility can run counter to immediate needs. But, armed with these ideas you should be able to affect some positive change. 

Accessibility is often a secondary goal; it's important but in a big pool of *very* important things. It's not that removed from the list of priorities but it can be something that gets lost in the developer's role or expected to be layered onto a product as polish. A direct ask for higher priority may seem like the obvious answer. After all, who would argue against accessibility? Unfortunately, it's not so easy to get success with that apprach. It's too nebulous to judge success to say nothing of value. Putting forth through simple process changes with specific, concrete gains that can be acheived is a much more practical approach.

The trick here is that accessibility contains universal values and good practices not just for users with accessibility needs. Design, business and development roles all can benefit.

  It may seem like a scare tactic but there are very real legal aspects to accessibility. I don't have much insight on this but to say it should be mentioned.
