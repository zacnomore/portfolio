    <h1>Zachary Svoboda</h1>
    <p>I'm a software developer with a love for interactive technology.</p>
    <p>I've been doing a lot of <g-link to="/writing/expanding-types-unobtrusively">Typescript</g-link> this 
      year from working in Angular. I'm currently diving deep into <g-link to="/writing/why-jamstack-is-actually-new">JAMstacks</g-link>, 
      I recently became a maintainer of a JAMstack framework built with Vue named <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>. 
      I've made a couple websites using it like this portfolio and <g-link to="/project/cilantro">a local resturant's 
      landing page.</g-link></p>
