Recently I saw [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhe-BXdQHl8) by [Mark Ferlatte](https://twitter.com/ferlatte) about getting the Healthcare.gov up and running back when it was struggling to serve its users. It's a great talk that gets its point across quickly (<5 minutes!) but to summarize, you have to prioritize. If you've even been in a sprint planning session where tech debt is competing with new features, you know how difficult it can be to argue about _needs_.

The site _needs_ to be accessible but the site _needs_ to be performant and the site _needs_ this new features but it also _needs_ the new button styles and don't forget the.... oh boy. No one is wrong here, these are all deeply important changes that are each serving the real needs of some people.

Of course, the question remains of what to do first. I've heard a number of ways to frame this question often centered around communicating that "firstness" that is at the heart. What can happen though, as I've seen, is the priority goes to discrete, obviously productive work. The nebulous work of handling tech-debt, accessibility, performance, security and so on lands deep in the backlog, if at all.

And so, I present to you a new way of pitching priority.
