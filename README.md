## Setup

This site uses a pretty bare-bones installation of gridsome. All you need to do to get everything together is:

```shell
yarn
```

To run a local development server:

```shell
yarn develop
```

To learn more about developing with Gridsome, view their documentation: https://gridsome.org/docs

## Deploy

Like magic. Every branch goes, the master branch is the proper site.

```shell
git push
```

## Development

There's a little bit of work to get a flawless dev environment and it's a bit dependent on platform. I'm generally working on this with VS Code on a Mac.
The normal vue tools are sufficient for most of it, Vetur. To get that last 10% of goodness will take substantially more work though. Refer to [the docs.](https://gridsome.org/docs/dev-tools/)
