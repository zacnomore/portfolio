## Setup

This site is a JAMstack built with gridsome. All you need to do to get dependencies setup is:

```shell
yarn
```

To run a local development server:

```shell
yarn develop
```

## Deploy

Like magic, every branch goes. The master branch is prod.

```shell
git push
```

## Development

There's a little bit of work to get a handsome dev environment and it's a bit dependent on platform. I'm generally working on this with VS Code on a unixy system, sorry if you have trouble on Windows!
The normal Vue tools are sufficient for most of it, Vetur. To get that last 10% of goodness will take substantially more work though. Refer to [the docs.](https://gridsome.org/docs/dev-tools/)
